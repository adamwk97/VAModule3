# Basic Analytical Techniques
Visual Analytics Module 3 Assignment 
To preface my analysis, however not to excuse it, I have very limited knowledge with Adobe Illustrator as well as color theory and the study of art in general. 

I have tried to convey my analysis of the data set I chose, mass shootings over the past 50 years in the United States, using a combination of complementary colors as well as vector graphics. The topic I chose is something that is not exactly light-hearted, so it was difficult to be creative and decorative while also maintaining a serious tone. If there is one thing I would have liked to make stand out and look more polished, it would be the dark red covering the white spaces of the map. I could not figure out how to blend the color or even fill it neatly as it would not let me directly paint over it, rather I had to make new layers and fill it in with the pen tool. Other than that, I am unsure what else I could have done with the skillset I have in Illustrator, however I do see the potential in learning it and would like to explore and create more projects in the future in order to more properly interpret my data.
